// havent checked the web config is required or not

1) create web config
2) create new controller (AutoNotificationController)
3) call the autoNotificationController in service impl when a notificatoin is added in the backend
4) update the notification using javascript

//this is working perfectly for one admin tab
//working on multiple admin tabs only if one notification is sent
//not working when multiple notifications is sent
