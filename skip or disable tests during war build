If you don’t need tests to run on your CI/build server (or you’ll run them separately), you can skip them:

mvn clean package -DskipTests





Or in your pom.xml:


<build>
  <plugins>
    <plugin>
      <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
      <configuration>
        <skipTests>true</skipTests>
      </configuration>
    </plugin>
  </plugins>
</build>


This will let Maven go straight to creating the WAR even if the DB connection in tests is broken.
